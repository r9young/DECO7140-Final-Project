    <h2>A Hopscotch Revival in Brisbane</h2>
    <p>
        In the quiet town of Brisbane, where children usually stayed indoors, glued to their screens, a surprising challenge was brewing. 
        It all started with Mrs. Sue, a retired schoolteacher who noticed that her grandchildren were spending more and more time isolated, 
        playing video games.

            One sunny afternoon, she invited her grandchildren, along with their friends, to try out an old game from her childhoodâ€”hopscotch. 
            Initially skeptical, the kids were soon intrigued by the colorful chalk designs she drew on the sidewalk. Mrs. Lee explained the rules, 
            and before long, they were eagerly tossing stones and hopping on one foot.
        </p>

            The physical nature of hopscotch, combined with the laughter and camaraderie it brought, was a stark contrast to the solitary hours 
            spent in front of screens. The children began to enjoy the fresh air and the joy of playing together. As they played, Mrs. Lee subtly 
            incorporated challenges that required teamwork and strategic thinking, skills they usually exercised in video games but now found 
            in a real-world setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Word of this fun, engaging game spread through the neighborhood. Soon, parents were encouraging their children to join Mrs. Lee's 
            hopscotch games instead of spending afternoons indoors. Every weekend, the sidewalks of Greenwood blossomed with colorful hopscotch 
            grids, each more intricate than the last.
